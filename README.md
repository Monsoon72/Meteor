# Meteor
C++ Meteor imitation

*The program contains two stages, press any key in your keyboard to change from stage 1 to stage 2. Stage 1 is the "Confession Letter", Stage 2 is the "Meteor Fall".*

NOTE: In order to see the full version of the meteor fall, please download the __Meteor__ folder. Make sure you also downloaded the folder called "images". Before you
open the Meteor.exe file, make sure the folder(images) is in the same directory/platform with the Meteor.exe file.  Ex: You can make a new folder and drag the Meteor.exe file and the images folder into it, then you are free to open :)
